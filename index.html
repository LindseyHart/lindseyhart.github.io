        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Lindsey Hart and I am an aspiring Software Developer. After 9 years as an elementary school teacher I decided to change careers and chose to go with coding. 
            I was introduced to software development after a few professional developments at the Tech Muesum in San Jose, CA. I also entered a 2 year long fellowship with them focused on
            software development and mechanical engeering. When I was deciding to take my life in a new direction, I choose this path as I find it truly facinating that a few lines of code 
            can do so many different things. Now after 2 years of studying I am ready to take on my first job in my new career.</p>
        <h2> Currently Working On...</h2>
        <p> I am currently finishing up a certificate in full stack development designed by IBM through Coursera's online learning platform. I am also learning Python through Mimo.com. My
            next step will be to learn Typescript through Mimo to increase my knowledge of coding languages. </p>

    <h1> Coding Projects </h1>
    <p>Here are a few of the coding projects I have worked on. I will continue to add to this as I gain more experience.</p>
    <br>
  
      <a href="http://lindseyhart.github.io/PacMan/">PacMen Factory</a><br>
     <p>  The above link will bring you to my pacman project. If you press the button add pacman then an image of pacman will appear. Then if you click start game they will move around the screen at random speeds.<br>
   </p>
      <a href="https://lindseyhart.github.io/eye-exercise/">Eye Exercise</a><br>
    <p>  The above link will bring you to my eye exercise project. For this project the screen will have a pair of eyes on it and as you move your mouse, the eyes will follow the mouse.<br>
       </p>
      <a href="https://lindseyhart.github.io/BusTracker/">Real Time Bus Tracker</a><br>
    <p>  The above link will bring you to my real time bus tracking project. This is still a work in progress.<br>

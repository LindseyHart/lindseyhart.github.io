    <p>Here are a few of the coding projects I have worked on. I will continue to add to this as I gain more experience.</p><br>
    
    <a href="https://lindseyhart.github.io/PacMan/">PacMen Factory</a><br>
    <p> The above link will bring you to my pacman project. If you press the button add pacman then an image of pacman will appear. Then if you click start game they will move around the screen at random speeds.</p><br>
      
    <a href="https://lindseyhart.github.io/eye-exercise/">Eye Exercise</a><br>
    <p> The above link will bring you to my eye exercise project. For this project the screen will have a pair of eyes on it and as you move your mouse, the eyes will follow the mouse.</p><br>
    
    <a href="https://github.com/LindseyHart/LogisticsShippingRates">Logisitics Shipping Rates</a><br>
    <p> This project was made using Python. It is a calculator to figure out what the shipping cost of an item is based on weight and the shipping rate.</p><br>
    
    <a href="https://github.com/LindseyHart/expressBookReviews">Express Book Review</a><br>
    <p> Here I have created a datebase using Express and Postman to store book reviews. Then they could be accessed by Title, Author, ISBN, or registered<br> user. You can complete all of the CRUD operations with this database. </p><br>
    
    <a href="https://github.com/LindseyHart/SinglePageApplication">Single Page Application</a><br>
    <p> Here is the code for a 4 page informational website with navigation using React.</p><br>
    
    <a href="https://lindseyhart.github.io/TriviaGame/">Trivia Game</a><br>
    <p> This is a webpage containing 3 trivia questions that keep track of when the correct anwser is clicked on. It gives the final score at the end.</p><br>
